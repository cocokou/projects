1. I have leared basic html elements and how to create a web page with these elements. 
2. So far so easy I guess that's because I already took an introductory course on Coursera.
3. The first time I tried to submit answer for a quiz. I finished the html and all worked fine. I just don't understand what code to paste there. Tried serveral times and went to the forums. Lucky for me, someone had the same question and I found the answer. 
4. just go google or mozilla
